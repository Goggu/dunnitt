Regretfully, I am unable to share .onion links, otherwise Medium will close my account. I am looking for clarification on this from their support team, but I have not received an answer. 

If there is a Clearnet location all you really need to do is a web search using the names below, same can be said for a .onion only site.. but with a little more effort involved. Whether you are a researcher or someone who just enjoys exploring the Dark Web, I hope these resources are of assistance to you. comes to keeping an online presence, privacy and security is paramount. 

But you might be unaware of how much of your personal information and data is actually floating around online. And all it takes for someone to get a hold of that data is for them to purchase that information from data brokers, such as people search sites. 

Luckily, the folks at Incogni are here to help ensure that that doesn’t happen.

This study assesses and compares the quality of sources found by undergraduate students when doing research using both Google and a library (federated) search tool. Thirty undergraduates were asked to find four sources (one book, two articles, and one additional source of their choosing) related to a selected research topic. Students used both Google and a federated search (resource discovery) tool to find material they believed to be relevant. Each source was evaluated for topic relevance, authority, appropriateness, and date, and assigned a total quality score. Results showed that the books found via Google were slightly higher quality than those uncovered via the federated search tool. The articles and additional sources students found via the federated search tool were slightly to moderately higher quality, respectively, than those discovered via Google."
