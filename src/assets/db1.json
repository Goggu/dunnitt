This study assesses and compares the quality of sources found by undergraduate students when doing research using both Google and a library (federated) search tool. Thirty undergraduates were asked to find four sources (one book, two articles, and one additional source of their choosing) related to a selected research topic. Students used both Google and a federated search (resource discovery) tool to find material they believed to be relevant. Each source was evaluated for topic relevance, authority, appropriateness, and date, and assigned a total quality score. Results showed that the books found via Google were slightly higher quality than those uncovered via the federated search tool. The articles and additional sources students found via the federated search tool were slightly to moderately higher quality, respectively, than those discovered via Google.",

As I was writing this article, I realized it started to get bigger and bigger, so I am making this a part 1, with another part or 2 or 3.. coming at a later date. Ransomware and Forums will also be on a separate article as dedicated time to that would make this article massive. I will briefly go into some of these resources you should know about when doing Cyber Threat Intelligence, along with some screenshots. A lot of these I will go into further in a future Medium article, as most deserve their own. Some of these have a Clearnet address, but all of them have a .onion address and most have no Clearnet address whatsoever. Regretfully, I am unable to share .onion links, otherwise Medium will close my account. I am looking for clarification on this from their support team, but I have not received an answer. If there is a Clearnet location all you really need to do is a web search using the names below, same can be said for a .onion only site.. but with a little more effort involved. Whether you are a researcher or someone who just enjoys exploring the Dark Web, I hope these resources are of assistance to you.This study assesses and compares the quality of sources found by undergraduate students when doing research using both Google and a library (federated) search tool. Thirty undergraduates were asked to find four sources (one book, two articles, and one additional source of their choosing) related to a selected research topic. Students used both Google and a federated search (resource discovery) tool to find material they believed to be relevant. Each source was evaluated for topic relevance, authority, appropriateness, and date, and assigned a total quality score. Results showed that the books found via Google were slightly higher quality than those uncovered via the federated search tool. The articles and additional sources students found via the federated search tool were slightly to moderately higher quality, respectively, than those discovered via Google.",
